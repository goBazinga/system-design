What is the difference between UDP and TCP?

There are set of information and rules that allows data to travel across a network. These information and rules are what we call internet protocols (IP). 

TCP [Transmission Control Protocol] and UDP[User Datagram Protocol] are Inernet Protocols (IP) that allow us to send and receive data across the network.
Primarily both do the same job but differ on how they do it. 

TCP first establishes connection and makes sure the interacting involved in transfer of data are in a state to commuiniate. 
UDP instead sends the message in a hope that it will reach the destination. 

TCP requires a handshake to occur first and is hence it is more reliable than UDP. It SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK handshake mechanisms to achieve this.
The connection is established in tree-way fashion. First it initates connection and acknowledges it. Second, it transfer the data packages and third it closes the connection.
So you can classify TCP as a connection-oriented protocol. In addition to this, TCP arranges packets in order and makes error detection easier.
For this reason, TCP is slower compared to UDP.
