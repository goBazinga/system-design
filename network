What is the difference between UDP and TCP?

There are set of information and rules that allows data to travel across a network. These information and rules are what we call internet protocols (IP). 

TCP [Transmission Control Protocol] and UDP[User Datagram Protocol] are Inernet Protocols (IP) that allow us to send and receive data across the network.
Primarily both do the same job but differ on how they do it. 

TCP first establishes connection and makes sure the actors involved in transfer of data are in a state to commuiniate. 
UDP instead sends the message in a hope that it will reach the destination.
